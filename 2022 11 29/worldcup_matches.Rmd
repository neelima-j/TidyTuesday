```{r load_data}
# Get the Data

# Read in with tidytuesdayR package 
# Install from CRAN via: install.packages("tidytuesdayR")
# This loads the readme and all the datasets for the week of interest

# Either ISO-8601 date or year/week works!

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2022-11-29')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2022, week = 48)

wcmatches <- tuesdata$wcmatches

# Or read in the data manually

wcmatches <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-29/wcmatches.csv')
worldcups <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-29/worldcups.csv')

```

```{r examine_data}
skim_without_charts(worldcups)
```

Goals scored over Years with crowd size as size.
Do more goals get scored when more people watch?
```{r plot_1}
worldcups<- worldcups %>% 
  mutate(attendance_bin = cut(attendance, breaks=9)) %>% 
  mutate(goals_per_match = goals_scored/games)
```

```{r}
worldcups %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = goals_per_match)) + 
  geom_point( aes(size = attendance_bin))+
  geom_line()+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.title = element_text(size = 22),
        plot.caption = element_text(size = 22),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 20),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 20),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 20),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 20)) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "",
       title = "Title",
       subtitle = "Subtitle",
       caption = "Visualization: Neelima-J | Source: Kaggle | #TidyTuesday") 
```


Stadium sizes and Attendance: USA has the biggest stadia?
Teams better organized, thus fewer goals?
